Welcome to this Full-Stack GPT-4-Turbo application.

Here's a quick rundown of the apps you'll find in the sidebar:

- **Document Chat**: Upload a document and ask questions about it. The app will use embeddings to find the most relevant parts of the document and answer your questions.
- **Quiz Generator**: Upload a document and the app will generate a quiz based on its content. You can then take the quiz and see your score.
- **SiteGPT**: Enter a URL and the app will create a chatbot that can answer questions about the site's content.
- **OpenAI Assistants**: A more advanced chatbot that can use tools to answer your questions.
