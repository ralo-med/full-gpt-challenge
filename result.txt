The XZ Utils backdoor, identified as CVE-2024-3094, was a sophisticated malicious code inserted into versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of the liblzma library, part of the XZ Utils software package. Discovered in February 2024 by Andres Freund, a Microsoft employee and PostgreSQL developer, the backdoor was embedded by an attacker using the pseudonym Jia Tan, who gained trust within the project over approximately three years. The backdoor allowed an attacker possessing a specific Ed448 private key to execute remote code via OpenSSH on affected Linux systems.

The mechanism involved malicious code that remained dormant unless specific conditions were met, such as the use of a third-party patch of the SSH server. The exploit used the glibc IFUNC mechanism to replace a function in OpenSSH, enabling potential remote system compromise. The backdoor was highly sophisticated, involving multiple stages of obfuscation and operational security, leading some experts to speculate it was the work of a state actor, possibly linked to Russian intelligence.

In response, major Linux distributions and vendors, including Red Hat, Debian, and SUSE, quickly reverted to earlier, unaffected versions of the affected packages. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued advisories recommending rollback to safe versions. The incident raised significant concerns about supply chain security, open-source trust, and the reliance on unpaid volunteers for critical infrastructure components.

The backdoor's discovery highlighted the potential for widespread impact, as the affected software was widely used across Linux distributions. The incident prompted discussions about the security of open-source projects and the importance of rigorous vetting and operational security in software development. The backdoor was effectively patched within hours of disclosure, but it remains a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in software supply chains and the importance of vigilant security practices.
