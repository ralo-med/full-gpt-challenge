Research about the XZ backdoor:

The XZ backdoor was discovered in February 2024 within the Linux build of the xz utility, specifically in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of the liblzma library. The malicious code was introduced by an individual or group using the pseudonym 'Jia Tan'. The backdoor allows an attacker possessing a specific Ed448 private key to execute remote code via OpenSSH on affected Linux systems. This vulnerability has been designated as CVE-2024-3094 and has a maximum severity score of 10.0.

The backdoor was detailed by Andres Freund, who discovered irregular activity in SSH connections, which led to his uncovering of the malicious modifications. These alterations manipulated liblzma to load malicious code under certain building conditions, which could potentially allow full system compromise. The backdoor was part of an effort that lasted over three years, involving attempts to gain influence within the project and subsequent signing of compromised versions.

The mechanism involved injecting malicious code into the liblzma library, which, when loaded by certain patched SSH server configurations, could hijack the authentication process and grant unauthorized access. Efforts to mitigate the threat included reverting to previous stable versions and security advisories issued by agencies like the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The incident highlighted vulnerabilities in open source supply chains and spurred discussions on security and trust in critical software components.

The response from Linux vendors, including Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian, was swift, reverting to safe versions and advising users accordingly. The incident raised concerns about the security of open source projects and the sophistication of cyber threats targeting critical infrastructure.
